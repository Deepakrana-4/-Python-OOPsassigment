        "#PYTHON OOPs QUESTIONS\n",
        "\n",
        " 1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        " >  OOP is a way of writing code where we think in terms of real-world things like:\n",
        " CARS\n",
        " DOG\n",
        " We call these \"objects\" in programming.\n",
        "Each object has:\n",
        "1-Data (what it has): like name, color, age\n",
        "2-Behavior (what it does): like walk, talk, drive\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.  What is a class in OOP\n",
        ">> CLASS in oop is like a recipe or plan to make objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.  What is an object in OOP\n",
        ">>an objet in oops is using the recipe (class), you create real cars.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        " >> Abstraction means hiding the extra details and showing only the useful part.\n",
        " Encapsulation means hiding the data inside a class and only allowing access through methods (functions). It protects the data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5.  What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        " >>Dunder\" means Double UNDerscore — so dunder methods are special methods in Python that start and end with two underscores\n",
        " example __init__  \n",
        "   \n",
        " 6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        " >> It’s like a child getting things from parents — name, habits, or skills.\n",
        "In code:\n",
        "1-A parent class has some functions and variables.\n",
        "2-A child class can use them without writing again.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 7.  What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        ">>In OOP, it means one function or method behaves differently based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        ">>1. By using private variables and methods\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "  9.  What is a constructor in Python\n",
        ">>>  A constructor is a special function that automatically runs when you create an object from a class.\n",
        "In Python, the constructor is the __init__() method\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10.   What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        ">>@classmethod\n",
        "A class method is a method that works with the class itself, not just the object.\n",
        "It takes cls as the first argument (instead of self)\n",
        "You can use it to change or access class-level data\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod\n",
        "A static method is a method that doesn’t need the class (cls) or the object (self) at all.\n",
        "It’s just a regular function inside a class\n",
        "You use it when you don’t need to access object or class data\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 11.  What is method overloading in Python\n",
        ">>Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (like number, type, or order of arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12.   What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        ">>Method Overriding means redefining a method in a child (derived) class that already exists in the parent (base) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.  What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        ">>The @property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a \"getter\" — meaning, it can be accessed like a variable without using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        ">>1.Code Reusability and Flexibility\n",
        "  2.  Cleaner and More Readable Code\n",
        "  3. Easier to Maintain and Extend\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 15.  What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        ">>An abstract class is a class that:\n",
        "Cannot be instantiated on its own.\n",
        "Defines one or more abstract methods—methods without implementation—that must be implemented by any concrete (sub)class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16.  What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        ">>> advantage of oop\n",
        "  1.Modularity\n",
        "  2.Reusability\n",
        "  3.  Polymorphism\n",
        "  4. Easy Maintenance & Upgrades\n",
        "  5. Real-world Mapping\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 17.  What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        ">>>Multiple Inheritance means a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
        "This allows a child class to combine features (methods/attributes) from multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 18.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        ">> Class Variable  1.\tClass memory (shared across all instances)\n",
        "                   2.All instances of the class\n",
        "   Instance Variable  1.Object memory (separate for each instance)   \n",
        "                      2.  Only that specific object (instance)         \n",
        "\n",
        " 19.   Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        ">>>__str__ Purpose: For end users\n",
        "  __repr__ Purpose: For debugging/developers\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        ">>The super() function is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) inside a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "  >>The __del__() method in Python is known as a destructor.\n",
        "\n",
        " 22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        ">>Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define non-regular methods inside a class — i.e., methods that don’t behave like normal instance methods (self).\n",
        "\n",
        " 23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritanc\n",
        " >>Polymorphism means: same interface, different behavior.\n",
        "When combined with inheritance, it allows subclasses to provide their own version of a method defined in a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        ">>>Method Chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after the other, using dot (.) notation.\n",
        "Each method in the chain returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on it.\n",
        "\n",
        " 25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " >>The __call__() method in Python allows an object to be called like a function."
